# Summary

This is a project to re-implement some `C++ STL Containers` to understand them.

Some requirements for this project are as follow:

Re-implement 

+ `std::vector`
+ `std::map`
+ `std::stack`
+ `std::set`
+ `std::iterators_traits`
+ `std::reverse_iterator`
+ `std::enable_if`
+ `std::is_integral`
+ `std::equal` and/or `std::lexicographical_compare`
+ `std::pair`
+ `std::make_pair`

## What is STL?

The `Standard Template Library (STL)` is a set of `C++ template classes` to privde common programming data structures and fuctions such as `list`, `stack`, `vector`, etc [^STL]

`STL` has four componets

+ Algorithms
+ Containers
+ Functions(Functor)
+ Iterators
